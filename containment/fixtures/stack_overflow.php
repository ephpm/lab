// Induces a C-STACK OVERFLOW inside PHP's object-destructor cascade.
//
// Freeing a long chain of plain objects recurses in C —
// zend_object_std_dtor() <-> zend_objects_store_del() — one frame per node,
// with no VM checkpoint in between. Past a few tens of thousands of nodes that
// exhausts the executing thread's stack and the guard page faults (SIGSEGV).
//
// Without `[php] crash_containment` this kills the whole server process. With
// it, the fault is contained: this request gets a 500 and the pool thread that
// ran it is retired and replaced. Nothing in PHP userland can catch this — no
// try/catch, no `disable_functions`, no memory_limit — which is exactly why the
// interception has to happen at the signal handler.
//
// USED BY: crates/ephpm-e2e/tests/crash_containment.rs (its own isolated node).
// Requesting it on a node WITHOUT containment will crash that server on purpose.

// Deep enough to blow a thread stack with margin (the recursion needs well
// under 100 bytes per node, and pool threads get Rust's 2 MiB default), while
// staying far below any sane memory_limit — a memory bailout would ALSO produce
// a 500 and would silently pass a test that meant to prove containment.
// Overridable so the threshold can be probed by hand.
